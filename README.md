Site topic: `3D modeling courses`  
Site language: `RU`

### 📚 What was implemented by me:

- The site was made with `Bootstrap v4.6` + `CSS Grid`
- Implemented fully responsive layout with main breakpoints at - `690`, `510`, `320`
- Work done with `Pixel Perfect`

### 🐍 My comments on this work:

🔸 This is one of those jobs on which I had to use Bootstrap (or rather, as I had no choice) because it was homework (i think this was the first and last time i used it)  
🔸 The layout itself is not to say that it was especially well-made by the designer, I had to correct a lot myself  
🔸 In terms of ease, it is probably the simplest, but this is not certain
